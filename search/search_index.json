If you\u2019ve ever built with LEGO, drawn a robot on paper, or sketched an idea in your notebook, you\u2019ve already done the thinking part of CAD.</p> <p>CAD allows you to take these ideas and see them in a 3D space. Using CAD, you can see how parts interact with each other, and edit your geometry as needed before manufacturing anything. It's a tool thats used very often in the engineering world. </p> Commonly Used CAD Software  <p>There are several CAD platforms that FRC teams commonly use. Each has its strengths depending on the team\u2019s needs, school devices, or personal preference. Our preference at 1391 is Onshape due to the existing FRC part libraries, and collaboration features. Here are some popular CAD softwares:</p> <ul> <li>Web based, acts like a Google Doc</li> <li>Great for collaboration</li> <li>Beginner friendly interface</li> <li>Free for FRC teams &amp; students</li> </ul> <ul> <li>CAM Capabilities (Computer-Assisted Manufacturing)</li> <li>Good for quick modeling</li> <li>Free for students (education license)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Industry standard</li> <li>Powerful but PC-only</li> <li>Free licenses available through FIRST</li> </ul> Uses in FRC <p>In FRC, teams use CAD to plan their robots before building them. It saves time, avoids mistakes, and makes collaboration way easier. A crucial part of the build season is CADding the robot before machining it. Here\u2019s an example using FRC 1678's 2025 robot.</p> How to Setup an Onshape Account <ol> <li>     Go to the Onshape Education page to get started.   </li> <li>     Scroll down and enter your first name, last name &amp; westtown.edu email address. This is required to access the free education license. </li> <li>     Verify your email by clicking the confirmation link sent to your Westtown inbox.   </li> <li>     Complete the onboarding steps\u2014 you might be asked about your role (student) and experience level.   </li> <li>     Once registered, you\u2019ll have access to the full Onshape education platform and can start designing! </li> </ol>  So I have an Onshape Account... What now?  <p>CADding is just like riding a bike, or driving a car. It may seem intimidating at first, but with practice, it becomes easier. It's a crucial skill to learn for both FRC and Engineering. To help you in this journey, there are a variety of learning courses that you can find on this website.
